This project is a demonstration of my expertise in Flutter, showcasing a fully functional Weather App and News App developed to meet all assignment requirements. Both apps are interconnected, feature-rich, and designed with a focus on user experience, performance, and modern UI/UX principles. Below is an overview of the features, architecture, and skills applied in this project.

Project Overview

The Weather App provides real-time weather updates and forecasts, leveraging location-based services and dynamic UI elements. The News App delivers categorized news headlines, search functionality, and offline reading capabilities. Both apps are seamlessly integrated with shared features like pull-to-refresh and dark/light mode support, showcasing Flutter’s capabilities for building responsive, cross-platform applications.

Weather App Features
Real-Time Weather Updates: Automatically detects the user’s location to display current weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, and more.
5-Day Weather Forecast: Provides detailed weather predictions for the next five days, enabling users to plan ahead.
City Weather Comparison: Allows users to compare weather conditions between their city and other cities worldwide.
Dynamic UI/UX:
Animated Backgrounds: Inspired by Realme’s weather app, the background dynamically changes based on weather conditions, implemented using Flutter’s animation framework.
Dark & Light Modes: Supports theme switching for enhanced readability and user preference.
Alert Notifications: Sends push notifications for weather alerts in the user’s area, ensuring timely updates for critical conditions.
Offline Support: Caches weather data locally to display the last known conditions when the user is offline, improving accessibility.
Pull-to-Refresh: Implements a micro-interaction for refreshing weather data with a smooth, intuitive gesture.

News App Features
Categorized News Headlines: Displays news articles in categories such as Business, Technology, and Sports, fetched from a reliable API.
Search Functionality: Enables users to search for news articles and topics of interest with real-time results.

Readable Article View:
Supports dark/light mode for comfortable reading.
Includes zoom-in/zoom-in/zoom-out features for customizable text size.

Offline Reading:
Users can bookmark articles to a dedicated page for later reading.
Saved articles are accessible offline, stored locally for convenience.
Pull-to-Refresh: Provides a seamless content update mechanism for fetching the latest news.

Technical Highlights

Flutter Framework: Leveraged Flutter for cross-platform development, ensuring a native-like experience with a single codebase.
API Integration: Integrated weather and news APIs to fetch real-time data, with robust error handling and state management.
Location Services: Utilized geolocation APIs to detect user location for weather updates.
Local Storage: Implemented caching using packages like shared_preferences or hive for offline data persistence.
Animations: Created dynamic, weather-responsive backgrounds using Flutter’s animation APIs.
Push Notifications: Integrated notification services for weather alerts.
State Management: Employed a robust state management solution (e.g., Provider, Riverpod, or BLoC) for efficient data flow.
UI/UX Design: Designed intuitive, responsive layouts with attention to micro-interactions and accessibility.
